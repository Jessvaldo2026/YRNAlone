# YRNAlone (You aRe Not Alone) - Project Guidelines

## 🚨 THE GOLDEN RULE
**NEVER change working code. ONLY ADD or FIX.**

Always use the last working files as reference. If something works, leave it alone. Build on top of what exists.

## 🎯 Project Vision
YRNAlone is a mental health support app for lonely children and teens. We're building a $100M enterprise-ready application - not a demo, not a prototype. Real functionality that helps real kids.

## 🧸 The Teddy Bear Companions
These are the heart of the app - treat them with care:
- **Cloudy** - The comforting friend
- **Sunny** - The optimistic encourager  
- **Mocha** - The warm listener
- **Sprinkles** - The playful spirit
- **Luna** - The calm nighttime companion

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- **Styling:** CSS with cosmic dreams theme
- **Translations:** Multi-language support (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, French, etc.)

## ✨ Core Features
- Emotion Time Capsules
- Mood tracking & journaling
- Crisis support systems
- Voice recording functionality
- Community support groups
- Gamification (achievements, skill trees)
- B2B features for hospitals/clinics

## 📁 Before Making Changes
1. READ the existing file completely first
2. UNDERSTAND what's already working
3. Only ADD new functionality or FIX broken things
4. Test that existing features still work after changes
5. Keep the file structure consistent

## 🌍 Translation Rules
- All user-facing text must support translation
- Use the existing translation system/keys
- Add new keys to ALL language files when adding features

## 💬 Communication Style
Be direct. Explain what you're adding or fixing. Don't touch what works.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- Warm, welcoming, safe for children
- Cosmic dreams aesthetic
- Accessibility matters
- Mobile-first responsive design
